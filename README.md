# Machine-Learning-and-Pattern-Recognition

This course covers the main theories, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning and pattern recognition, starting with simple topics such as linear regression/classification and ending up with more advanced topics such as artificial neural networks, ensemble learning, and decision trees. For pattern recognition most popular feature extraction and feature selection techniques are introduced and Bayesian decision theory is studied. Main classical machine learning and pattern recognition techniques are considered with emphasize on how, why and when they work.
